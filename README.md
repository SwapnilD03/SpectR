## ‚öôÔ∏è Device Workflow
1. **Light Interaction:**  
   White LED light passes through a slit and the oil sample in a cuvette.  
   Transmission varies with impurity levels (Beer-Lambert Law).

2. **Spectral Capture:**  
   Transmitted light passes through a diffraction grating and is recorded by a CMOS camera.

3. **Data Transfer:**  
   Spectrum image is sent to Raspberry Pi ‚Üí uploaded to **Firebase Cloud Storage**.

4. **Remote Access & Analysis:**  
   Authorized users can download spectrum images, plot **Intensity vs Wavelength**, and run ML-based impurity detection.

5. **AI/ML Model:**  
   - **CNN-based classifier** for impurity detection & quantification (multi-class).  
   - **TinyML (tflite) model** for on-device binary classification (Pure vs Adulterated).
